2016-02-20: v0.4:
* Agents now release descriptor locks when a processing failure is encountered,
  thanks to the new unlock() Bus API. Analysis will be retried later if agents
  raise ProcessingError(retries, wait_time, msg). This improves reliability.
* Allow registering new selector-guessing functions.
* Facilitate injection of Descriptor with random hashes to facilitate
  re-analysis
* Unarchive agent: a list of passwords to be tried can be supplied
* New "write" agent that writes values of Descriptors to the disk.
* Various bug fixes
* No backwards incompatible changes.

2016-03-09: v0.3:
* Support for running external processes in separate namespaces using firejail.
* Bug fixes in rabbitbus: clean-up resources at agent exit. When a lot of
  short-lived agents were used (ex. inject), rabbitmq ended up using 100% CPU.
* rebus_infra: fix bugs in parameters parsing, add support for domains
* New rabbitmq integration tests
* Various bug fixes

2016-01-05: v0.2:
* New Bus implementation: RabbitBus based on RabbitMQ. A few rough edges left,
  but generally reliable.
* Bug fixes across the board: DBusBus reconnection attempts, thread-related
  issue in web interface
* Improvements to rebus_infra, rebus_master and rebus_agent launch scripts.
* Support for more file types.
* Support for more secure serialization mechanisms.
* Helper function to run external programs in isolated namespaces, using
  firejail (see example in dotrenderer agent).

2015-09-01: v0.1:
* Initial release
* 2 Bus implementations: LocalBus and DBusBus
* 2 Storage implementations: DiskStorage and RAMStorage
