REbus
=====

REbus facilitates the coupling of existing tools that perform specific tasks,
where one's output will be used as the input of others.

A few task examples:

* compute file hashes (md5, sha1)
* apply file identification tools (libmagic, peid, antivirus)
* extract files from archives
* extract printable strings from files
* nmap scans
* fetch network service banners
* fingerprint an SSL service to detect weak ciphersuites or configuration


Quick start
===========

Dependencies:

* python2.7
* mercurial (to interact with this repository only)
* setuptools
* python2-tornado >= 3.0 (debian squeeze packages v2.3)
* dbus
* python2-dbus
* python2-gobjects
* dbus-glib

To install these dependencies on Arch Linux:

.. sourcecode:: bash

  $ pacman -S mercurial python2 python2-setuptools python2-dbus python2-gobject dbus-glib python2-tornado python2-pip
  $ pip2 install python-magic==0.4.6


To install these dependencies on Debian Wheezy:

.. sourcecode:: bash

  $ aptitude install mercurial python-setuptools python-dbus python-gobject dbus-x11 python-pip
  $ pip install python-magic==0.4.6
  # tornado is too old in wheezy repositories
  $ pip install tornado

To install these dependencies on Ubuntu 14.10 (utopic) :

.. sourcecode:: bash

  $ apt-get install mercurial python-setuptools python-dbus python-gobject dbus-x11 python-pip python-tornado
  $ pip install python-magic==0.4.6

Quick installation & test:

.. sourcecode:: bash

  $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/iwseclabs/rebus
  $ cd rebus
  $ python2 ./setup.py install

  # list available agents
  $ rebus_agent --list-agents

  # If DBus is not already running on your machine, or on a headless machine.
  # Then run all commands in separate screen tabs.
  $ dbus-launch screen
  # run the bus master in terminal 1
  $ rebus_master_dbus

  # run a few agents, run each command in separate terminals
  $ rebus_agent --bus dbus web_interface
  $ rebus_agent --bus dbus unarchive

  # open a web browser on http://localhost:8080/
  $ firefox http://localhost:8080/


Components overview
===================

* Descriptors_ are REbus messages, conveyed to and from agents
* Agents wrap external tools, process and generate descriptors
* the `Communication Bus`_ lets agents communicate
* the Storage_ circulates and stores descriptors

Descriptors
-----------
Descriptors store agents' outputs and inputs as Python objects.

Descriptors have several properties:

* **selector** describes data type (â‰ƒ MIME type), contains unique identifier,
  e.g. ``/signature/md5/%6e1d5169661a50(...)f989129a583f92b9dee``
* **label** human name the descriptor relates to
* **uuid** group descriptors related to the same analysed object
* **value** descriptor value
* **precursors** list of parents' selectors
* **agent name** agent that produced this descriptor
* **domain** separates analyses
* **version** integer version if descriptor is updated
* **processing time** time taken to compute this descriptor

Descriptors may perform several actions:

* spawn new descriptor in the same UUID zone
* spawn new version of the same descriptor
* create link (linktype) descriptor
* serialization

Communication Bus
-----------------
The Bus API performs the following duties:

* allows agents to push Descriptors_
* broadcasts new Descriptors_' selectors to every agent (1st stage descriptor
  filtering by agents)
* allows agents to filter new descriptors based on their metadata and value
  (2nd stage filtering)
* keeps track of which agents have processed each descriptor
* allows several instances of one agent may run simultaneously
* conveys requests through the storage API

Two communication buses have been implemented:

* **LocalBus**: combine *n* agents to create a new composite command-line tool
* **DBusBus**: more interactive use, web interface, multi-process

LocalBus
''''''''
This bus implementation runs Agents as several threads in a single process.

The bus exits once every agent has finished carrying out its duties (ex.
injecting files, processing descriptors).

DBusBus
'''''''
This bus implementation runs Agents as separate processes.

The bus exits when the *bus master* process gets stopped by the user.

Agents may be run remotely, by connecting to a remote DBus.

This bus allows using the web interface.


Storage
-------
The storage API provides the following services to agents:

* find descriptor by selector regex
* find descriptor by uuid
* load/store agent internal state (bus resuming)
* mark descriptor as processed, list unprocessed descriptors

Two storage backends have currently been implemented:

* RAMStorage: stored data is forgotten when the bus exits
* Diskstorage: stores data as files. The bus may be stopped and resumed later

Provided agents
---------------

A few agents are provided with REbus. Their purpose is to assist using the bus,
not to perform any data analysis.

* **inject** inject local files in the bus
* **httplistener** inject Descriptors from HTTP POST requests
* **ls** list descriptors
* **unarchive** recursively extract archives, inject contained files
* **return** output descriptors to stdout if selector matches regexp
* **link_finder** find link between descriptors, e.g.\ same file type
* **link_grapher** create graphs from links between descriptors
* **dotrenderer** rendering dot to svg
* **web_interface** web interface


Building the documentation
==========================

This documentation is generated automatically, based only (for now) on source
code comments.

.. sourcecode:: bash

  $ cd rebus/doc

Make sure sphinx-apidoc2 and sphinx-build2 are installed on your system.
Override the SPHINXBUILD and SPHINXAPIDOC if the executables are named
differently.

.. sourcecode:: bash

  $ make generate

This will overwrite .rst files in source/.

.. sourcecode:: bash

  $ make singlehtml
